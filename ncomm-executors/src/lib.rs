//!
//! NComm-Executors provides a set of executors (kind of like schedulers)
//! for nodes.
//! 
//! The main idea with this create is to make executing nodes fit the specific
//! use case.  Specifically, there may be times when a Threadpooled model works
//! best or another use case where a Green-threaded Tokio implementation works best.
//! 
//! Ideally, this crate should contain all of the commonly used executors that
//! conform to the common ncomm-core traits to make creating robotics systems
//! as easy and pain-free as possible.
