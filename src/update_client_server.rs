//! Update Client - Update Server Communication
//! 
//! An Update Client + Server is a normal client that expects updates from the update server regarding
//! the status of the request that was sent.
//! 
//! Over time, a large number of update clients and servers will be developed using various methods
//! of data transfer and each should implement the UpdateClient and UpdateServer traits.
//!
